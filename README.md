# Personal Portfolio Website.

### 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Brett Karr

My personal portfolio website can be found here: https://bwkarr.vercel.app/

This is the GitHub repo for my personal portfolio website. I created this in an attempt to store all of my projects in an attempt to display my work. This will be a living document, and will be changing over time as I work on more projects and have more variety to demonstrate.

My portfolio was made with React, CSS, html, and a few other material-ui components. It was started off of an HTML5 UP template, which I converted to React and modified to fit my own personal style.
