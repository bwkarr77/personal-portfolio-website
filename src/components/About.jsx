        My name is Brett. I come from a small town of Carpinteria, CA. Growing
        up I played in the marching band, some sports, and a few random
        recreational activities. Eagle Scout, power lifter, weight loss(er), Smash Brothers enthusiast, and snacker are adjectives that I've gone by in the past.

        After high school I spent far too long at a local city college (SBCC),
        where I dabbled in most scientific fields until I landed on Mechanical
        Engineering. After SBCC I went to Chico State University, where I got my
        bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in
        manufacturing. I have been working as a Mechanical Engineer for the past
        6 years, and have decided to change career fields to focus on web
        development and computer science.
